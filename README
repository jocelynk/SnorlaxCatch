How to Play:
You're Snorlax and a trainer is trying to catch you. You've been disturbed
from your sleep and you're angry! 

Use WASD to move, and use your cursor's position to rotate your head.
Remember that your head will face in the opposite direction of your cursor.
Click anywhere ingame to open your mouth and devour the pesky Pokeballs 
that are flying around. Being Snorlax, you can only stay awake and keep 
your mouth open as long as your PP bar isn't empty. Don't get hit when 
you're asleep! Getting hit by Pokeballs while asleep will take some HP
until you faint and get captured, and you must avoid that at all costs.
The trainer intends on making you lose 800 lbs after capturing you,
and you definitely don't want that to happen.

Ideas from Week 1:
* Canvas drawing
    - All sprites are custom-drawn via Canvas commands
    - Transformations are used to manipulated drawings
* First-class functions
    - Many code snippets are pulled into first-class functions
      for reusability.
* Object-oriented Design / Inheritance
    - The Pokeballs are individual objects, and the GreatBalls
      inherit from the pokeballs.
* Event Listeners
    - Uses keydown/keyup events for smooth keyboard movements
    - Uses mousemove event for cursor positioning
    - Uses mousedown event for clicks
* Minimal clobbering of global scope
    - The game itself is encapsulated in a SnorlaxMunch object,
      so as to avoid binding/clobbering in the global scope.
